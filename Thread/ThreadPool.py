Python ThreadPool
A thread pool is a collection of threads that are created in advance and can be reused to execute multiple tasks.
The concurrent.futures module in Python provides a ThreadPoolExecutor class that makes it easy to create and manage a thread pool.

In this example, we define a function worker that will run in a thread.
 We create a ThreadPoolExecutor with a maximum of 2 worker threads. We then submit two tasks to the pool using the submit method. The pool manages the execution of the tasks in its worker threads. We use the shutdown method to wait for all tasks to complete before the main thread continues.

Multithreading can help you make your programs more efficient and responsive.
However, itâ€™s important to be careful when working with threads to avoid issues such as race conditions and deadlocks.

import concurrent.futures


def worker():
    print("Worker thread running")


# create a thread pool with 2 threads
pool = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2)

# submit tasks to the pool
pool.submit(worker)
pool.submit(worker)

# wait for all tasks to complete
pool.shutdown(wait=True)

print("Main thread continuing to run")
